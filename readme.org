#+title: CL-XFIG

Package for generating figures in xfig's format.  

* Code status
  Under design and early development

* Code design

** Base level
   CLOS-based code that
   - defines objects that store xfig's primitives
   - ~make-...~ functions for creating those objects
   - ~emit-...~ methods for dumping the objects into a file
   - Object duplication and manipulation facilities
     - Mirroring
     - Moving
     - Scaling
     - Rotating
     - Grouping


   The base level uses Xfig's basic units, and is somewhat user
   unfriendly.  More user friendliness is achieved in the next level.

** User level
   - User friendly fig object definitions
   - More sophisticated object cloning facilities
   - A container object that contains the whole figure and emits it
     according to the order specified by the Xfig standard
